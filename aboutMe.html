                <p>Hello! My name is Mary Sauls. I am an undergrad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computational Media.
                    I attended the University of Alabama as a Computer Science major for a year before transferring. 
                    Throughout the years, I have had a lot of exposure to programming. When I was younger, I created a mod for Minecraft and began 
                    venturing into robotics with a Lego Mindstorms Robotics kit. As I got into Middle School and High School, I was able to join my 
                    school's FIRST Robotics teams. Although I mainly wanted to do programming, it gave me a lot of exposure other things like mechanical engineering,
                    design, safety, and buisness. The FIRST Robotics program was really a great way for me to explore more aspects in an engineering field other than 
                    what I had already been exposed to, as well as introducing me to other students from other schools all over the state with similar interests as me. 
                    Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unfortunately unable to complete my senior year on the team, as everyone went into quarantine. 
                    Starting college the next year by myself in a new place was culture shock enough; however, online classes and a continued pandemic made the situation worse. 
                    I was unable to join any clubs or really meet any new people at all. It really put a damper on trying to get involved with robotics, 
                    but I was still able to work on my skills in a C course I was taking. 
                    However, I learned that I didn't just want to sit at a desk and code all day. I wanted to be creative and help design things, so I transferred to 
                    Georgia Tech as a Computational Media major, where I can put both of those aspects together and try to learn more about User Interface and Experience.</p>
                <p>And that brings me to today, thank you for checking me out! 
                    If you would like a copy of my resume, please fill out your information in "Contact Me" and indicate so. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
