                <p>This was a group project for LMC2700 Introduction to Computational Media. 
                    For this project, a group of students had to create a functioning Twitter Bot.
                    The bot our group created retweets a tweet from #mediaarts every hour. 
                    It takes a tweet and counts the syllables in the sentence. 
                    If it doesn't have seventeen syllables, it moves to the next one. 
                    When a tweet has the right amount of syllables, it parses the tweet into the 5/7/5 format.

                <p>Another project for the LMC2700 course was replicating an image in A-Frame. 
                    We had to take a 2D image and convert it to a 3D scene. 
                    Essentially, we were to make paintings into sculptures.
                    As I was new to A-Frame, I chose "Composition of Red, Yellow, and Blue" by Piet Mondrian.
                    The image above is the oil painting, and the link will take you to the A-Frame.

                <p>For my final project in LMC2700 Introduction to Computational Media, I was tasked with creating a video game using 
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My partner and I decieded to go with a game based off of Sega's Frogger. 
                    Instead of an infinite world with cars and logs, we decided to make it a timed game with logs and lily pads. 
                    The goal is to use the arrow keys to hop across the body of water on the moving logs and stationary lilypads. 
                    I coded this project, while my partner did the write up and formal documentation. 
                    It is only a prototype; however, I really enjoyed this project and hope to update it in the future.
